You are given a vector V of size n. You need to print its elements.Just complete the function iter() that takes two iterators as parameters, i.e., 
starting and ending iterators. In a new line, print the required output.

void iter(vector<int>::iterator it1,vector<int>::iterator it2)
{
    //Your code here. Use iterator to print all the elements
    for (auto it=it1;it!=it2;it++)
    {
        cout<<*it<<" ";
    }
    cout<<endl;
}
